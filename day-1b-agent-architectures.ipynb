What if there was a way to break down these challenges by introducing a team of intelligent, independent agents working in concert? Enter the world of multi-agent systems (MAS), a paradigm shift that's empowering developers to build more robust, efficient, and intelligent software.\n\n**Main Sections:**\n\n**1. Enhanced Problem Solving Through Specialization and Collaboration**\n    *   **Decomposition & Specialization:** Break down monolithic problems into smaller, manageable sub-problems, assigning each to an agent with specific expertise. This allows for focused development and easier debugging.\n    *   **Synergistic Collaboration:** Agents can communicate, share information, and coordinate their actions to achieve a common goal that no single agent could accomplish alone, leading to more sophisticated solutions.\n    *   **Parallel Processing Power:** Different agents can work on their assigned tasks concurrently, significantly reducing overall processing time and improving application responsiveness.\n\n**2. Increased Robustness and Resilience in Your Software**\n    *   **Fault Tolerance:** If one agent fails, others can often pick up its slack or adapt their behavior to compensate, preventing system-wide outages and ensuring continuous operation.\n    *   **Dynamic Adaptability:** MAS can react to changing environments and unforeseen circumstances by reconfiguring agent roles, introducing new agents, or modifying communication protocols on the fly.\n    *   **Graceful Degradation:** In resource-constrained situations, the system can intelligently shed non-critical agent tasks, maintaining core functionality rather than crashing entirely.\n\n**3. Unleashing New Levels of Intelligence and Autonomy**\n    *   **Intelligent Decision-Making:** Individual agents can possess learning capabilities, making localized intelligent decisions that contribute to the overall system's smart behavior.\n    *   **Emergent Behavior:** Complex and sophisticated system-level behaviors can emerge from the simple interactions of multiple autonomous agents, often leading to solutions that were not explicitly programmed.\n    *   **Scalability and Flexibility:** Easily add or remove agents to scale the system's capabilities up or down as needed, without requiring significant architectural overhauls.\n\n**4. Practical Applications and Getting Started**\n    *   **Real-World Examples:** Explore how MAS are already being used in areas like distributed simulations, intelligent transportation systems, supply chain management, and complex data analysis.\n    *   **Tooling and Frameworks:** Briefly introduce popular MAS development tools and frameworks (e.g., JADE, SPADE, or agent-based modeling platforms) that can help developers get started.\n    *   **Mindset Shift:** Emphasize the need for a shift in thinking from imperative, step-by-step programming to a more declarative, interaction-focused approach.\n\n**Concluding Thought:** Embracing multi-agent systems isn't just about adopting a new technology; it's about fundamentally rethinking how we design and build software. By empowering our applications with a network of intelligent, collaborating agents, we unlock a future of more resilient, adaptable, and powerful solutions that can tackle the increasingly complex challenges of the digital world.

What if there was a way to break down these challenges by introducing a team of intelligent, independent agents working in concert? Enter the world of multi-agent systems (MAS), a paradigm shift that's empowering developers to build more robust, efficient, and intelligent software.\n\nMAS fundamentally changes how we approach problem-solving. Instead of a single, monolithic application, we can decompose complex challenges into smaller, specialized tasks, assigning each to an agent with specific expertise.

In a MAS, if one agent falters, others can often adapt and compensate, preventing system-wide failures. This fault tolerance, combined with the dynamic adaptability to changing environments and graceful degradation under resource constraints, makes your software far more resilient.

Individual agents can learn and make localized decisions, leading to emergent, sophisticated system-level behaviors that weren't explicitly programmed. This also allows for remarkable scalability; simply add or remove agents to adjust capabilities.\n\nFrom distributed simulations to intelligent transportation, MAS is already making waves.

You've now created a reliable \"assembly line\" using a sequential agent, where each step runs in a predictable order.\n\n**This is perfect for tasks that build on each other, but it's slow if the tasks are independent.** Next, we'll look at how to run multiple agents at the same time to speed up your workflow.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"---\n### Section 4\n## 🛣️ Parallel Workflows - Independent Researchers\n\n**The Problem: The Bottleneck**\n\nThe previous sequential agent is great, but it's an assembly line. Each step must wait for the previous one to finish. What if you have several tasks that are **not dependent** on each other? For example, researching three *different* topics. Running them in sequence would be slow and inefficient, creating a bottleneck where each task waits unnecessarily.\n\n**The Solution: Concurrent Execution**\n\nWhen you have independent tasks, you can run them all at the same time using a `ParallelAgent`. This agent executes all of its sub-agents concurrently, dramatically speeding up the workflow. Once all parallel tasks are complete, you can then pass their combined results to a final 'aggregator' step.\n\n**Use Parallel when:** Tasks are independent, speed matters, and you can execute concurrently.\n\nTo learn more, check out the documentation related to [parallel agents in ADK](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/agents/workflow-agents/parallel-agents/).\n\n**Architecture: Multi-Topic Research**\n\n<!--\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[\"User Request: Research 3 topics\"] -- > B[\"Parallel Execution\"]\n    B -- > C[\"Tech Researcher\"]\n    B -- > D[\"Health Researcher\"]\n    B -- > E[\"Finance Researcher\"]\n\n    C -- > F[\"Aggregator\"]\n    D -- > F\n    E -- > F\n    F -- > G[\"Combined Report\"]\n\n    style B fill:#ffffcc\n    style F fill:#ffccff\n```\n-->","metadata":{"id":"U37FxKxDBtHE"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<img width=\"600\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/github-repo/kaggle-5days-ai/day1/parallel-agent.png\" alt=\"Parallel Agent\" />","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 4.1 Example: Parallel Multi-Topic Research\n\nLet's build a system with four agents:\n\n1. **Tech Researcher** - Researches AI/ML news and trends\n2. **Health Researcher** - Researches recent medical news and trends\n3. **Finance Researcher** - Researches finance and fintech news and trends\n4. **Aggregator Agent** - Combines all research findings into a single summary","metadata":{"id":"U37FxKxDBtHE"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Tech Researcher: Focuses on AI and ML trends.\ntech_researcher = Agent(\n    name=\"TechResearcher\",\n    model=\"gemini-2.5-flash-lite\",\n    instruction=\"\"\"Research the latest AI/ML trends.

The `SequentialAgent` and `ParallelAgent` produce their final output and then stop. This 'one-shot' approach isn't good for tasks that require refinement and quality control. What if the first draft of our story is bad? We have no way to review it and ask for a rewrite.\n\n**The Solution: Iterative Refinement**\n\nWhen a task needs to be improved through cycles of feedback and revision, you can use a `LoopAgent`. A `LoopAgent` runs a set of sub-agents repeatedly *until a specific condition is met or a maximum number of iterations is reached.* This creates a refinement cycle, allowing the agent system to improve its own work over and over.\n\n**Use Loop when:** Iterative improvement is needed, quality refinement matters, or you need repeated cycles.\n\nTo learn more, check out the documentation related to [loop agents in ADK](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/agents/workflow-agents/loop-agents/).\n\n**Architecture: Story Writing & Critique Loop**\n\n<!--\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[\"Initial Prompt\"] -- > B[\"Writer Agent\"]\n    B -- >|story| C[\"Critic Agent\"]\n    C -- >|critique| D{\"Iteration < Max<br>AND<br>Not Approved?\"}\n    D -- >|Yes| B\n    D -- >|No| E[\"Final Story\"]\n\n    style B fill:#ccffcc\n    style C fill:#ffcccc\n    style D fill:#ffffcc\n```\n-->","metadata":{"id":"fP4I3mvtBtHF"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<img width=\"250\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/github-repo/kaggle-5days-ai/day1/loop-agent.png\" alt=\"Loop Agent\" />","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 5.1 Example: Iterative Story Refinement\n\nLet's build a system with two agents:\n\n1. **Writer Agent** - Writes a draft of a short story\n2. **Critic Agent** - Reviews and critiques the short story to suggest improvements","metadata":{"id":"fP4I3mvtBtHF"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# This agent runs ONCE at the beginning to create the first draft.\ninitial_writer_agent = Agent(\n    name=\"InitialWriterAgent\",\n    model=\"gemini-2.5-flash-lite\",\n    instruction=\"\"\"Based on the user's prompt, write the first draft of a short story (around 100-150 words).\n    Output only the story text, with no introduction or explanation.\"\"\",\n    output_key=\"current_story\", # Stores the first draft in the state.\n)\n\nprint(\"✅ initial_writer_agent created.\")","metadata":{"id":"a2b8WlJoBtHF","outputId":"13ed1e15-dcf9-4e1d-ad1e-fb18ee793de5","trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-11-10T19:30:45.645702Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-11-10T19:30:45.646319Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-11-10T19:30:45.652463Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-11-10T19:30:45.646275Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-11-10T19:30:45.651215Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"✅ initial_writer_agent created.\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":35},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# This agent's only job is to provide feedback or the approval signal.

Does he feel fear, wonder, or a sense of destiny? A brief internal monologue or a physical reaction (e.g., trembling hands, a sharp intake of breath) could deepen the reader's connection to his experience.\n2.  **Elaborate on the \"Map to Nowhere\":** The description of the map is evocative, but a little more detail could enhance the mystery. Are the symbols static, or do they move? Do they resemble anything Elias might vaguely recognize, even if it's not a place? This could add layers to its enigma.\n3.  **Hint at the \"Promise\":** The \"promise whispered on the wind\" is a nice touch, but the story could benefit from a slightly more concrete, albeit still mysterious, hint of what that promise might entail. Is it a promise of adventure, treasure, or something more profound? A subtle clue could fuel the reader's imagination further.\nRefinerAgent > Elias, the keeper of the Saltwind Light, polished the brass of the Fresnel lens until it gleamed like a captured sun.
